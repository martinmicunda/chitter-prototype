Chitter Prototype
=================

Chitter allows developers to share useful information quickly and informally using a social, micro-blogging approach.

The main task of the project is to develop prototype that will be present to the rest of the [Asidua](http://asidua.com/) (Chitter) group so group can decide which prototype to move forward with to develop Chitter Application.

Development Principles
----------------------

+ Chitter will be developed using responsive web design techniques
+ Chitter will be developed using suitable JavaScript and CSS frameworks
+ Chitter will be developed in a manner that does not tie it to one specific database type
+ Chitter will be developed in line with modern web architectural patterns
+ Chitter will be developed in a manner that will support the addition of mobile clients in the future
+ Chitter will be developed using Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)
+ Chitter will be developed using Continuous Integration, Delivery & Deployment
+ Chitter will be developed in a manner that will support public cloud deployment
+ Chitter will be developed using freely available tools and frameworks (no Asidua licenses will be required)
+ Chitter will be developed using tools and frameworks that are not tied to a single platform (e.g. Windows)

Installation
----------------------

### Platform & tools

You need to install Node.js and then the development tools. Node.js comes with a package manager called [npm](http://npmjs.org) for installing NodeJS applications and libraries.
* [Install node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/) (requires node.js version >= 0.8.0)
* [Install Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) as global npm modules (requires node.js version >= 0.8.0):

    ```
    npm install -g grunt-cli
    ```

### Client App

Our client application is a straight HTML/Javascript application but our development process uses a Node.js build tool
[Grunt.js](gruntjs.com). Grunt relies upon some 3rd party libraries that we need to install as local dependencies.

* Install local dependencies (navigate to chitter-prototype directory):

    ```
    cd client
    npm install
    cd ..
    ```

(Note: If you are getting error with github try this "git config --global url."https://".insteadOf git://")

### Server App

Our backend application server is a NodeJS application that relies upon some 3rd Party npm packages. You need to install these:

* Install local dependencies (navigate to chitter-prototype directory):

    ```
    cd server
    npm install
    cd ..
    ```

Running
----------------------

### Start the Server

There are two options how to run application (command line or Intellij IDEA)

####From command line
* Run the server (the command will automatically opens web browser)

    ```
    node server/server.js    
    ```

* Browse to the application at [http://localhost:3000]

####From Intellij IDEA
Install Node plugin for your Intellij and then go to Edit -> Edit Configurations and set details as it show below 

![Run Chitter Server from Intellij IDEA](/_resources/images/node_server.png "Run Chitter Server from Intellij IDEA")

Development
----------------------

### Continuous Building
The watch grunt task will monitor the source files and run the default build task every time a file changes (it will refresh browser for you).

####From command line

```
cd client
grunt watch 
```

####From Intellij IDEA

![Run Grunt watch task](/_resources/images/grunt_watch.png "Run Grunt watch task")
